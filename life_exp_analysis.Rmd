## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse, gapminder)
data(gapminder_unfiltered)
```

```{r}
#see how data looks like
gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  head()
```

```{r}

gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  group_by(year)%>% 
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(year)
```
